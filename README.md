# ld-query
A tiny lib to assist in querying JSON-LD documents.

The JSON-LD W3C specification is available here: "https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/".

This library aims to assist with querying json-ld documents **in their expanded form**. It is worth noting that although the JSON-LD expansion algorithm is defined in the [JSON-LD expansion API standard]., there's no implementation of the expansion algorithm.
